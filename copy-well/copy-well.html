			<p class="content-copy">
				By migrating from a single, large project for the certification exam to multiple, smaller projects, weâ€™ve<br />made the newest MOS a much more powerful instrument for assessing student skills.
			</p>
			<p class="content-copy">
				Students and teachers will now be able to devote more time to practice and mastery on the specific skills<br />tested in each smaller project. Students can complete a smaller project, continue their studies, and<br />complete the next project.
			</p>
			<p class="content-copy">
				This improvement allows students to focus their studies and enhance the learning process. It also allows<br />the exams to test skills more broadly and deeply.
